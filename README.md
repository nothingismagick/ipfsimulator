ipfs simulator v0.0.1
Interactive Documentation and Project Creator

FIRST RUN GREETING:
Hi, my name is Sim U. Lator, and you can ask me questions any time
you are on this machine (even outside of the simulation). If you need
interactive help with ipfs, ipld and node, for example, just type:

$ ipfs sim help ipfs ipld node

And I'll put together some dynamic help for you.

FIRST RUN GET STARTED:
You are here to do something cool with protocol labs kit, 
but you haven't done anything yet. I see you have several git 
accounts on this machine, may I use one of them to create your projects?

0. No! Just a test please.
1. github.com/nothingismagick
2. gitlab.com/nothingismagick

> 2

Great! I'll use github.com/nothingismagick to create all the 
repositories. You can change this later, if you like, by running 
`ipfsimulator new game`

Let's get started.

I can't seem to find a compatible language stack on your machine. I
can install that for you, would you like to work with:

1. go
2. node.js

> 2

Ok. I am installing the latest version of node.js, npm and yarn.

Downloading node v9.8.0

This might take a little while. Do you want to read up on a few key
concepts behind IPFS, IPLD, libp2p etc?

> no

OK. Prefer to play a game of CLI-Snake while you wait?
